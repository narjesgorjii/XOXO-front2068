# Project Phase 2: React Development

Welcome to the second phase of your project! In this phase, you will be setting up a React application, developing a UI/UX based on a Figma design, and connecting the app to an API you created in the first phase.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies

First, you need to clone the provided repository and install the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the development server. You should see your React application running in your browser.

### 2. Develop the UI/UX from Figma Design

Next, you will develop the UI/UX as specified in the provided Figma design. Follow the link below to access the design:

[Figma Design for Gaming Website](https://www.figma.com/design/auNugnfKF5eREyI5PqGurR/gaming-website?node-id=0-1&t=29hCDtGGZFbYiKev-1)

1. Analyze the design and understand the components you need to create.
2. Break down the design into reusable React components.
3. Implement the components and ensure the layout matches the Figma design.

### 3. Connect to the API

Finally, you will connect your React application to the API that you developed in the first phase of this project.

1. Ensure your API server is running.
2. Use the `fetch` API to make API calls from your React components.
3. Display the data retrieved from the API in your UI components.

Example of fetching data in a React component:

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("http://your-api-endpoint")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data))
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Error fetching data: ", error);
      });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {data.map((item) => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

## Additional Notes

- Make sure your project follows best practices for code structure and organization.
- Pay attention to the responsiveness and accessibility of your design.
- Test your application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.

Happy coding!
